### Hi there üëã

I am a junior iOS developer. I'm starting to build my portfolio. If you are a developer I hope you find interesting stuff, any suggestion as well as ‚≠êÔ∏è üòâ is wellcome üòÑ  . If you are recruiting and you think I might fit with any apply you can contact me and üí¨.

There are three projects at this moment but number will grow in coming weeks. 

The first wave will be several mini-projects showing some cool ideas and skills.

The second wave will be two projects, one using UIKit and other one using SwiftUI.

## List of projects:

### RealityKit & Factory pattern

A demonstrator of Factory pattern in Augmented Reality context. Goal is create a set of predefined virtual objects and manipulate them without knowledge of RealityKit.
I intented show the fusion of consolidated practices & an innovate framework. Tradition & disruption.

### UIKit, Core Data and more in a library app

A library for board games. App implements the CRUD cycle. UIKiT is the choosen framework for the UI, Core Data for the persistance. Logic is been implemented with Command design pattern. Everything is carried with TDD & unitary tests approach.

App is in development. Now, Create & Read operations of CRUD cycle are ready.

### Swift Charts in action

The goal of this repository is show features that can be developed with Swift Charts through different user cases. At this point I will remark the feature where a chart can be used as input of data (chartOverlay is essencial); it goes further than only visualize data.

In parallel to swift charts, the logic for the user cases is done taken TDD approach & unitary tests. Logic makes intensive use of functional programming.

### Layouts-SwiftUI

I think SwiftUI is more than an incredible framework for software developing. It can be used for design layouts and templates with excellent visual results and total control of each component of the creation.

I used SwiftUI to create my background profile in LinekedIn. Code is here

New layouts will be added.
