### Hi there 👋

I am a junior iOS developer. I'm starting to build my portfolio. If you are a developer I hope you find interesting stuff, any suggestion as well as ⭐️ 😉 is wellcome 😄  . If you are recruiting and you think I might fit with any apply you can contact me and 💬.

There are two projects at this moment but number will grow in coming weeks. 

The first wave will be several mini-projects showing something cool ideas and skills.

The second wave will be two projects one using UIKit and other one using SwiftUI.

## List of projects:

### RealityKit & Factory pattern

A demonstrator of Factory pattern in Augmented Reality context. Goal is create a set of predefined virtual objects and manipulate them without knowledge of RealityKit.
I intented show the fusion of consolidated practices & an innovate framework. Tradition & disruption.

### Layouts-SwiftUI

I think SwiftUI is more than an incredible framework for software developing. It can be used for design layouts and templates with excellent visual results and total control of each component of the creation.

I used SwiftUI to create my background profile in LinekedIn. Code is here

New layouts will be added.
